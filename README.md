**Tic Tac Toe (Two Player) Game with Tkinter**
This is a simple and stylish implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library for GUI. The game supports two players who take turns playing on a 3x3 grid. The player who first aligns three of their marks (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

**Features**
Two-player mode: The game allows two players to play alternately.

**Styled interface:** The game board and buttons are styled with distinct colors for players and a clean, modern look.

**Responsive layout:** The grid cells adjust their sizes to fit the available space, ensuring an equal-sized board on any screen.

**Winner detection:** The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game results in a draw.

**Game reset:** After a win or a draw, the game board is reset to allow for a new round.

**How It Works**

Player Turns: Players take turns clicking on an empty grid cell to place their mark (either 'X' or 'O'). The current player is shown in the button colors.

Winning Condition: The game checks for a winner after every move. A player wins if they have three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

Draw Condition: If all grid cells are filled and no player has won, the game declares a draw.

Reset Board: After a win or a draw, the game board resets automatically, and players can start a new game.
